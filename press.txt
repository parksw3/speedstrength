Epidemics can be characterized by strength (Rt) and speed (doubling time). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an control measures can be evaluated on this scale. We develop a mathematical framework that shows that speed-based analysis of control is a useful complement to traditional, strength-based analysis. We show that both approaches can provide useful insights, and each may be clearer in different situations. We provide examples from HIV and COVID-19. This perspective can help to clarify assumptions and conclusions from disease-control models.
