Electronic supplementary material:
All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final form. They will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on the online figshare repository. Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI. Please try to submit all supplementary material as a single file.


Online supplementary material will also carry the title and description provided during submission, so please ensure these are accurate and informative. Note that the Royal Society will not edit or typeset supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details (authors, title, journal name, article DOI). Your article DOI will be 10.1098/rspb.[paper ID in form xxxx.xxxx e.g. 10.1098/rspb.2016.0049].


Please submit a copy of your revised paper within three weeks. If we do not hear from you within this time your manuscript will be rejected. If you are unable to meet this deadline please let us know as soon as possible, as we may be able to grant a short extension.

Comments to Author:
The referees are generally positive about the changes that were made to the manuscript. However, one reviewer continues to raise important questions about the covid-19 example - and also about whether an example of this type is possible. I strongly recommend that these points are carefully reflected upon and new discussion is included in the next version. Overall, I think that this is a very good contribution to the epidemic modelling literature. I might not have thought that before 2020 but this pandemic has made me think differently.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have addressed most of the concerns but have not opted to include non-constant growth, estimation or the other topics, preferring instead to focus on their main conceptual point. in the midst of a pandemic, infectious disease modelers are busy, so this is understandable and the Editors need to decide whether they would have preferred the authors to expand.
The main change in this new version is the COVID-19 example, in which the authors describe in words (but do not model or justify with mathematics) how their framework helps to interpret the relationship between presymptomatic transmission and control. They say that an increase in the estimated importance of presymptomatic transmission might be expected to increase the difficulty of control, but that more early transmission for a given r means less transmission per individual, so that controls are actually easier. I think this example does not help because it is unclear for the reasons below.
Consider the example of a policy ensuring that symptomatic people self-isolate (a school or workplace might have such a policy, sending everyone with symptoms home immediately). This reduces transmission, but what transmission remains is from  a- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Here, the growth rate r isn’t fixed - there’s less transmission. The “importance” of pre-symptomatic transmission is higher, though. So this is perhaps not an example, but what is an intervention other than something targeting symptomatic individuals that would accomplish such a shift and why would it leave r constant?.
The crux of the argument is the phrase “for a given r” -- and use of the generic “importance” instead of either “amount” or “fraction” ( both of which would have made clear whether the intervention reduces the total transmission by reducing transmission after symptoms, or does something else that shifts the timing of transmission). Also in this particular case, with the policy that symptomatics go home, actually other interventions (like contact tracing) do get harder in the sense that earlier transmission is harder to stop by contact tracing, even if less of it is needed because the total number of transmissions expected has been reduced.
I think the other reason it’s not quite right is that it’s hard to think of an intervention that would leave the rate of growth fixed but change the timing of transmission (so changing the relationship between R and the rate of growth by changing the generation interval). So the conditioning on constant r is a little hard to picture.
In the response document there are many points where the authors note that R might not be constant but r might be, or vice versa. Concrete examples would help. I could imagine that constant R (people infect the same mean number) but different r (they do so more or less quickly) could occur if the course of viral infection within the host changes (for genetic or host reasons) ; if people compensate for good symptomatic testing by taking more risks before symptoms.. reaching the same R but at a different time in their infection; but these feel quite just-so and I am left with the same sense of reaching for a concrete example that I had in the last version.

Keywords: mathematical epidemiology, reproductive number, exponential growth rate, speed and strength
Abstract: An epidemic can be characterized by its strength (i.e., the reproductive number R) and speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale.   Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r=0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R=1, and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of “test-and-treat” interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection.  We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.
