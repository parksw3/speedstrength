JD to take next step or half-step about this MS

Should we just submit early to JRSI? Talk next time. Remember possible collaborators but don't rush to invite.

We're going to just get this done: collect additional ideas and find some way forward for them, maybe by inviting lots of people to help on followups

Daniel is going to Princeton!
* Irregular meetings until he gets sorted (and maybe after as well)

This paper
* Maybe aim for Interface (that level) with JD first
	* Add someone with more specific expertise if necessary (Christophe, Wim?)
* Keep in mind whether to do a higher-impact version, presumably led by Daniel, later
	* David E., Brian G., David C?

Daniel will send a possible single-author paper
* unless he doesn't
* this is tangential and JD should ignore for now 2019 Sep 11 (Wed)
