Daniel is going to Princeton!
* Irregular meetings until he gets sorted (and maybe after as well)

This paper
* Maybe aim for Interface (that level) with JD first
	* Add someone with more specific expertise if necessary (Christophe, Wim?)
* Keep in mind whether to do a higher-impact version, presumably led by Daniel, later
	* David E., Brian G., David C?

Daniel will send a possible single-author paper
* unless he doesn't
