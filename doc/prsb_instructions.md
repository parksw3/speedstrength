Comments to Author:
Both reviewers agreed on the value of the concepts presented in this paper. The second reviewer makes some points, specific and general, that I think could lead to extensions/revisions of the paper that would make it stronger and of more interest. I think that this paper provides important ideas for the field and look forward to seeing a revised version.
