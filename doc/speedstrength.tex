\section{To do}

JD to edit once-through by 2019 Sep 18. I don't know if we can meet.

Add a bigger perspective from Eaton and Hallett (SWP can start on that if time). Look also (less important) and Bellan and Dushoff's follow-up to Hollingsworth.

Talk about speed-like and strength-like estimates of an epidemic (e.g., HIV growth rate vs.~measles mean susceptibility) and of an intervention.

\section{Introduction}

An epidemic can be characterized by its \emph{speed} and \emph{strength}.
The speed of an epidemic, often characterized by the exponential growth rate $r$, measures how \emph{fast} an epidemic grows, at the population level. 
The strength of an epidemic, often characterized by the reproductive number $\RR$, measures how many new cases are caused by a typical \emph{individual} case.
Knowing the speed and strength of an epidemic allows predictions about the course of the epidemic and the effectiveness of intervention strategies.

Much research has prioritized estimates of the reproductive number, because it has a threshold value, $\RR=1$ that determines whether a disease can invade, the level of equilibrium, and the effectiveness of control efforts. 
The insight that a case must on average cause at least one new case under good conditions for a disease persist goes back $>100$ years \citep{ross1911prevention};
the idea of averaging by defining a `typical' case was formalized 30 years ago \citep{diekmann1990definition}.
$\RR$ is also of interest because it provides a \emph{prima facie} prediction about the total \emph{size} of an epidemic \citep{anderson1991infectious, ma2006generality, miller2012note}. 

Like epidemic strength, epidemic speed measures how disease spreads in the population. 
Here, we generalize the idea of a threshold for successful intervention by measuring an intervention's ``strength'' on the same scale as the reproductive number. 
We then show that we can likewise measure an intervention's ``speed'', and that there is a duality between the threshold $\RR=1$ and a corresponding minimal intervention strength, and the threshold $r=0$ and a corresponding minimal intervention speed. \jd{Tried to clarify in your direction.}
We argue that the historical primacy of $\RR$ over $r$ is partly artificial, and discuss cases where strength provides the better framing for practical disease questions and cases where speed does.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Epidemic model}

We model disease incidence using the renewal-equation framework, a simple, flexible framework that can cover a wide range of model structures \citep{Champredon2018equivalence}.
In our model, disease incidence at time $t$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
i(t) = \int K(\tau, t) i(t-\tau) d\tau.
\end{equation}
Here, $K(\tau, t)$ is the infection kernel describing how infectious we expect an individual infected $\tau$ time units ago to be in the population.
In general, $K(\tau, t)$ will depend on population characteristics that may change through time $t$ -- notably, the proportion of the population susceptible.
Since we are interested in invasion and control, we will generally neglect changes in $K(\tau, t)$ through time, thus we will assume $K(\tau, t) \equiv K(\tau)$. 
This means we are neglecting changes in susceptible proportion through time;
under this assumption, the renewal equation is equivalent to the Von Foerster equations, outlined in \cite{fraser2004factors}.

\subsection{Strength-based decomposition}

Assuming that the infection kernel $K$ doesn't change with time, we write:
\begin{equation}
	K(\tau) = \RR g(\tau),
	\eqlab{strength}
\end{equation}
where $g(\tau)$ is the ``intrinsic'' generation-interval distribution (giving the relative infectiousness of the average individual as a function of time since infection) \citep{champredon2015intrinsic}. 
Since $g$ is a distribution, it integrates to 1, and the reproduction number $\RR$ is thus the integral of $K$.

Imagine a control measure that proportionally reduces $K$, for example by protecting a fixed fraction of susceptibles. We then have:
\begin{equation}
	\hat K(\tau) = (\RR/\theta) g(\tau).
\end{equation}
Since $g$ is a distribution, the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease)  is exactly $\theta=\RR$. We call $\theta$ the ``strength'' of the intervention; transmission is interrupted when the strength of the intervention $\theta$ is larger than the strength of spread \RR.

We generalize this idea by allowing an intervention strategy to reduce $K$ by different proportions over the course of an individual infection. We write the post-intervention kernel:
\begin{equation}
	\hat K(\tau) = K(\tau)/L(\tau), 
\end{equation}
where $L(\tau)$ is the average proportional reduction for an individual infected time $\tau$ ago.
The post-intervention reproductive number is thus:
\begin{equation}
	\Rhat = \int \hat K(\tau) d\tau
\end{equation}
This framework generalizes the work of \cite{fraser2004factors} who made parametric assumptions about the shape of $1/L(\tau)$.

We define the strength of the intervention $L$ to be $\theta = \RR/\Rhat$. It is then straightforward to show that $\theta$ is the harmonic mean of $L(\tau)$ weighted by generation-interval distribution:
\begin{equation}
	\theta = 1/\langle 1/L(\tau) \rangle_{g(\tau)}.
\end{equation}
In this more general case, we have again that the disease cannot spread when $\theta \geq \RR$. 

\subsection{Speed-based decomposition}

The Euler-Lokta equation allows us to calculate the initial exponential growth rate $r$ of an epidemic given an infection kernel $K$:
\begin{equation}
	1 = \int K(\tau) \exp(-r\tau) d\tau
	\eqlab{euler}
\end{equation}
By analogy with the strength-based factorization \eqref{strength}, we can rewrite the Euler-Lotka equation \eqref{euler} as a speed-based factorization:
\begin{equation}
K(\tau) = b(\tau)\exp(r\tau)
\end{equation}
Like $g$, $b$ is a distribution: in this case the initial backward generation interval, which gives the distribution of realized generation times (measured from the infectee's point of view) when the disease spreads exponentially \citep{champredon2015intrinsic, britton2019estimation}.

Now imagine an intervention that reduces transmission at a constant hazard rate $\phi$ across the disease generation, for example by identifying and isolating infectious individuals.
We then have:
\begin{equation}
	\hat K(\tau) = K(\tau)\exp(-\phi\tau) = b(\tau)\exp((r-\phi)\tau)
\end{equation}
Since $b$ is a distribution (which integrates to 1), the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease)  is exactly $\phi=r$. 
We call $\phi$ the ``speed'' of the intervention; transmission is interrupted when the speed of the intervention is faster than the speed of spread.

We generalize this idea by allowing the hazard rate $h(\tau)$ at which $K$ is reduced to vary through time, thus:
\begin{equation}
	\hat K(\tau) = K(\tau) \exp\left(-\int_0^\tau h(\sigma) d\sigma\right)
\end{equation}
The associated post-intervention epidemic speed $\hat r$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
	1 = \int \hat K(\tau) \exp(-\hat r\tau) d\tau.	
\end{equation}
We define the speed of a general intervention to be $\phi = r - \hat r$. 
We can then show that $\phi$ is a (sort of) mean satisfying:
\begin{equation}
	1 = \left\langle \frac{\exp(\phi \tau) }{\exp\left(\int_0^\tau h(\sigma) d\sigma\right)} \right\rangle_{b(\tau)}
\end{equation}
The speed $\phi$ is a mean of the hazard $h$ in the sense that an increase (or decrease) in $h$ produces the same sign of change in $\phi$, and if $h$ is constant across the generation then $\phi=h$.

\section{Intervention strategies for HIV}

In this section, we use both strength- and speed-based decompositions to compare different intervention strategies for the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
These examples are meant to provide neither precise nor accurate estimates of the effectiveness of intervention strategies; 
instead, we use these examples to demonstrate how strength- and speed-based decompositions can help us better evaluate each control strategy under different scenarios.
In particular, we study how the amount of early HIV transmission affects our decision.

We model the infection kernel of the HIV as a sum of two gamma distributions:
\begin{equation}
K(\tau) = \mathcal R \left(\tsub{p}{early} \tsub{f}{early}(\tau) + (1-\tsub{p}{early}) \tsub{f}{late}(\tau) \right).
\end{equation}
The first component, $\tsub{f}{early}(\tau)$, models early HIV transmission during the acute infection stage.
We assume that $\tsub{f}{early}(\tau)$ has a mean of 3 months \citep{hollingsworth2008hiv} and a shape parameter of 3.
The second component, $\tsub{f}{late}$, models HIV transmission during the asymptomatic stage and the disease stage (after progression to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)).
We assume that $\tsub{f}{late}(\tau)$ has a mean of 10 years \swp{need to cite something and/or change this value} and a shape parameter of 2 (this vaguely approximates the wide generation-interval distribution of the HIV \citep{fraser2004factors}).
Finally, $\tsub{p}{early}$ is the proportion of early HIV transmission.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\textbf{The infection kernel of the HIV.}
A. The infection kernel of the HIV is approximated using a sum of two gamma distributions. We assume that the baseline proportion of early transmission is 23\% \citep{hayes2006amplified}.
B. Time series of HIV prevalence in pregnant women in South Africa, 1990 - 2010 \citep{barron2013eliminating}. The initial exponential growth rate of the HIV is estimated by fitting a straight line to log-prevalence (1990 - 1997) by minimizing the sum of squares.
C. Increasing the proportion of early transmission reduces the estimate of the reproduction number.
}
\figlab{example}
\end{figure}

As our baseline scenario (\figref{example}A), we assume that early transmission is responsible for 23\% of the total transmission \citep{hayes2006amplified}.
Based on the growth rate estimate ($0.452 \textrm{year}^{-1}$; \figref{example}B) from HIV prevalence in pregnant women in South Africa \citep{barron2013eliminating}, our baseline reproduction number is $3.17$.
Further increasing the amount of early transmission reduces the mean generation time, which in turn decreases the reproduction number (\figref{example}C);
therefore, we expect stronger (but not necessarily faster) intervention to be required in order to control the disease when there is more early transmission.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\textbf{Understanding condom intervention using strength-based decomposition.}
A. Condom use is thought to reduce probability of transmission by a similar factor throughout the course of infection; thus the proportional reduction $L$ due to condom use is constant across the course of infection. 
B. The estimated amount of early transmission affects estimated strength of the epidemic but not of a condom-based intervention.
}
\figlab{condom}
\end{figure}

We consider a condom intervention that reduces HIV transmission by approximately 75\% at the population level. \jd{I'm not sure we need to be worried about weller2002condom, nor about population vs.~individual level effects. Many estimates of efficacy are higher than 80\%, and it's certainly possible to imagine an intervention that involves education about condom use.}
Assuming that condoms act as a physical barrier, and that condom use will on average remain roughly constant through time, it is reasonable to model the proportional reduction in transmission due to condom use as constant across the course of infection: $\tsub{L}{condom} = 1/(1-0.75) = 4$  (\figref{condom}A).
The estimated strength of such an intervention is simply the average of $L$: $\theta=4$, whereas the estimated strength of the epidemic increases as the proportion of early transmission decreases (\figref{condom}B).
Thus, the predicted effectiveness of the condom intervention will depend strongly on our estimate of the importance of early transmission: if early transmission is low, we expect disease spread to be too strong to be controlled completely by our intervention.

\caption{
\textbf{Understanding test-and-treat intervention using strength- and speed-based decomposition.}
A. Test-and-treat intervention $\tsub{L}{test}$ starts at 1 and saturates after about 5 years.
B. Increasing the amount of early transmission decreases the strength of an epidemic as well as the strength of test-and-treat intervention.
C. Hazard rate $\tsub{h}{test}$ of test-and-treat intervention $\tsub{L}{test}$ peaks and plateaus very quickly and reaches zero after about 5 years.
D. The amount of early transmission has no effect on the speed of an epidemic and small effect on the speed of intervention.
We assume $\tsub{L}{test}(\tau) = \exp\left(\int_0^\tau h(\sigma) d\sigma \right)$ and $h(\tau) = \tsub{h}{max} (1 - \exp(- K f(\tau)))$, where $f(\tau)$ is a gamma probability density function with a mean of $12$ months and a shape parameter of 2, $K = 4/\max(f(\tau))$, and $\tsub{h}{max} = 1/6$.
}
\figlab{test}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, consider a test-and-treat strategy in which infected individuals are identified and put to clinical care (e.g., antiretroviral therapy).
We can model this intervention $\tsub{L}{test}$ as a saturating function that begins at 1 and plateaus at a sufficiently high value (such that identified individuals are effectively no longer infectious);
in particular, we assume that all individuals will be identified and put to treatment within the first 5 years since their infection (\figref{test}A).
Under this assumption, the strength of intervention decreases as the proportion of early transmission increases but is always higher than the epidemic strength; 
however, it is unclear why this should be the case.

Using the speed-based decomposition allows us to understand the problem much more clearly.
The hazard rate $\tsub{h}{test}$ of this intervention starts at 0 (because infected individuals don't have a way to know that they have HIV when they're infected) but peaks very fast (because individuals are actively getting tested and treated); 
the hazard rate goes down soon after the peak and reaches 0 after about 5 years because infected individuals who have access to medical care would have been identified within the first 5 years or so.
The speed of epidemic stays constant regardless of the proportion of the early transmission because epidemic speed corrresponds to the observed growth rate.
The speed of intervention stays roughly constant but slightly increases as proportion of early transmission increases \swp{because?}.
This framework clearly demonstrates that test-and-treat intervention will be effective regardless of the proportion of early transmission.
